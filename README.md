## Devlog
The metaphor I would use to describe the relationship between Components, Game Objects and Scenes is that it's like writing a sentence. This is because components are similar to letters, and like how letters make up words, Components make up Game Objects. And since Game Objects are like words, then just like how we use words to create sentences, we can use Game Objects to create Scenes because Scenes are made up of several Game Objects put together. Therefore, like how letters make up words and words make up sentences, Components make up Game Objects which make up Scenes.
